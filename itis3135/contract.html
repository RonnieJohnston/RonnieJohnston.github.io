            <h2>Course Contract</h2>
            <h3 class="left-align">
                I, Ronnie Johnston agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, ITIS3135,
                Web App Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
                <br>
                <br>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly avalible online tools will be avalible to the world, and will not
                put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
                failure to turn in assignments may show absences.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find my examples online or
                even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut
                and paste code except where I have properly given credit(i.e external libraries) and never from my
                classmates.
                <br>
