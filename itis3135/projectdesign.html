            <h3 class="left-align">Client website description and purpose:</h3>
            <p class="left-align">
                The purpose of the client-driven website is to display my client's interest in painting "Warhammer" miniatures.  A driving factor in the game's success is the ability to paint and cusomize miniature models to the user's liking.<br />
                Who the website is intended for:<br />
                The website is intended for those interested in Warhammer/Warhammer 40k, and want an example of someone who is also getting into the game.<br />
                Content Overview:<br />
                The website will be separated into a standard 5-page format: Home/Landing page, Gallery, FAQ, About the Client, and Contact.  
            </p>
