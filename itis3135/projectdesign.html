            <h3>Client website description and purpose:</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of the client-driven website is to garner attention to a small business involving the painting of "Warhammer" models (miniature figures).  It will contain information about the client's business, examples of their work, and some information about the client's love for painting them.
                Who the website is intended for:
                The website is intended for those looking to get someone to paint their models for them, and for the client to use for their business.
                Content Overview:
                The website will be separated into a standard 5-page format: Home/Landing page, Gallery, About the Client, Paint and Brush Types, and Contact.
