        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: Born and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Living on campus at UNCC.  I love video games and tabletop games
                    (mainly Magic: the Gathering), and I love space and space travel.</li>
            <li>Professional background: No professional background yet.  Aim to become a software engineer.</li>
            <li>Academic background: I'm an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
                    Computer Science (B.S.).</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I've worked with computers from an early age, and have ever since been intrigued by programming.</li>
            <li>Primary computer platform: Windows 10 on both my Desktop and Laptop (not upgrading to Windows 11 yet).</li>
            <li>Courses I'm taking: 
                <ul class="sub-ul">
                    <li>ITIS3135 Web App Design and Development</li>
                    <li>ITIS3130 Human Centered Design</li>
                    <li>ITCS3160 Database Design and Implementation</li>
                    <li>ECON2101 Principles of Economics (Macro)</li>
                    <li>GEOG1101 World Regional Geography</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Funny Story: When I was learning to drive with an instructor, I picked a route that I thought would be easy to return from.  Turns out I didn't
                    actually know how to get back home, so I just winged it and somehow managed to get back on track without anyone suspecting anything.</li>
            <li>Something interesting: NASA only uses 15 digits of pi.  In fact, if you used only 40 digits of pi, you could measure the 
                    entire universe with atom-sized precision.</li>
