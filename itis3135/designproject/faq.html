      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h2>
        - The Structure of a Warhammer 40k Turn -
      </h2>
      <h3>
        1.) Movement Phase
      </h3>
      <p>
        &emsp;&ensp;During the movement phase, you can pick one of your units to become mobile. Keep in mind that you’ll have several different units that comprise a larger army.<br /><br />
        &emsp;&ensp;You can move the members of a unit in any direction, as long as the distance doesn’t exceed the set amount for that specific model on the character datasheet. All movement is measured in inches, so you’ll need to have a tape measure handy.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <h3>
        2.) Psychic Phase
      </h3>
      <p>
        &emsp;&ensp;The models labeled as a “psyker” on their datasheet can harness psychic powers. You can use these powers, but they come with a risk. Rolling a double one or a double six during the psychic test will mortally wound your psyker.<br /><br />
        &emsp;&ensp;So, what is a psychic test? It determines whether your psyker gets to utilize the power of your choice.<br /><br />
        &emsp;&ensp;Rolling two six-sided dice and getting a total that’s more or equal than the power’s warp charge value means that you can successfully execute an attack.<br /><br />
        &emsp;&ensp;Otherwise, you’ll have to try again during your next turn.<br /><br />
        <h3>
          3.) Shooting Phase
        </h3>
        <p>

          &emsp;&ensp;During the shooting phase, you have to select a unit to shoot with. You can only shoot with models that come equipped with ranged weapons, and they have to be farther than one inch away from your enemy.<br /><br />

          &emsp;&ensp;After one model in your unit finishes shooting, you can continue shooting with your other models that carry ranged weapons. This goes on until all of these models take a turn shooting.<br /><br />

          &emsp;&ensp;But before you fire your weapons, you need to figure out who you’re going to shoot. You can only shoot enemies that are visible from your model’s viewpoint, and the weapon you choose affects how many attacks your model can make.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h3>
          4.) Charge Phase
        </h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&ensp; In the charge phase, your units can throw themselves towards the enemy to attack. The unit you choose during the charge phase has to stand within 12 inches of the enemy. Prior to your charge attack, the enemy gets the chance to retaliate by firing Overwatch.<br /><br />

          &emsp;&ensp; You’ll then have to roll two six-sided dice to see how far your unit can advance. The number on the dice equates to how many inches you can move towards your enemy.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h3>
          5.) Fight Phase
        </h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&ensp; Now here’s where things get bloody. Any models (including your opponent’s) that have charged or stand within one inch of an enemy can attack during the fight phase.<br /><br />

          &emsp;&ensp; If some members of your unit are too far from your enemy, you can move them three inches in any direction that points towards your target.<br /><br />

          &emsp;&ensp; After choosing your target and determining what melee weapon to use, you’ll have to figure out how many attacks your model can make using your model’s attack characteristic.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h3>
          6.) Morale Phase
        </h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&ensp; After you’ve completed an exhausting battle, some of your units have fallen. This means that you’ll have to take a morale test.<br /><br />

          &emsp;&ensp; To do this, you need to count every model that has been defeated, roll a dice, and then add the number of fallen models to the number on the dice.<br /><br />

          &emsp;&ensp; If this number isn’t higher than the leadership characteristic in that unit, then you’ll have to retire a certain amount of models based on the gap between the two numbers.
