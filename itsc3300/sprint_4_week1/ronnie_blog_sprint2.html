    <h2>Resource Constraints: What are they and how to adapt to them</h2>

            <li>Imagine a world where you had unlimited resources to create anything you want.  If you had a project you would want to complete, you would have unlimited time and materials to see it through.  Unfortunately, this is not the case in the real world, and while some projects find themselves with ample resources, the majority of projects will have to mind their constraints.  After all, someone has to provide those resources, and thus those resources are under their jurisdiction.  In this blog, I’ll cover what constraints can look like, and how you can adjust to them in order to succeed.</li>        
        </ul>
        <h3>The Common Constraints</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>1. Cost constraints: these are the barebones framework constraints that your team will have to follow.  The project can essentially be boiled down to how much money is spent on this or that, and what is the limit for the stakeholders.  When planning, cost is the biggest constraint, as you select cost-efficiency over best-fit in a large portion of decisions.  The thing to keep in mind is that cost can either make stakeholders happy or frustrated, and you really cannot afford to have them frustrated for long.</li>
            <li>2. Time constraints: rolling off the back of cost constraints, time constraints can sound very similar.  After all, time is money, but there are some clear cases of time constraints hitting more than cost constraints.  If you have elite software/hardware but less-than-stellar employees then you could easily run the risk of hitting the time ceiling (which essentially is the time “budget”).  These time constraints also go hand-in-hand with the next constraint.</li>
            <li>3. Scope constraints: these involve how much or how little many features you want to include in your project.  This topic has been covered before, but in short you really want to watch how your scope could dangerously grow as more features get suggested.  Remember that even if you have the money to implement new features, you may not have enough time.  This ultimately reflects in your project’s scope.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Beating Constraints</h3>

        </figure> 
        <ul class="order">
            <li>Now that we’ve covered the most common constraints you will find in project management, it’s time to cover some approaches to overcome those constraints.  Note that no one situation you’ll find yourself in is identical to any other, and results can vary with some of these, but generally they will aid in working with constraints.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Contingency Plans</strong> have been mentioned before, but just like with risk management, they can also help with constraints.  You could have a contingency plan in the case that one of your resources is getting stretched towards its constraint too much.  For example, your plan could trigger when the budget gets too close to the constraint, and would involve a reassessment of what resources are really necessary for the project’s goals.  This may also involve inspecting the project scope, handling scope creep at the same time.  Overall, contingency plans are the “safety net” of your project, and are useful in a variety of situations as long as everyone is on the same page and knows them beforehand.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritization and Critical Path</strong> is another previous topic covered here, but in short you want to have a clear understanding of where your project’s priorities are.  If something that doesn’t have high priority is using up a lot of your resources, then they could be a threat to your resource constraints.  A good way to understand what your priorities are is to create a critical path analysis.  This analyzes each task in your project and determines which tasks are the most important by which ones have the least amount of wiggle room in terms of time.  Essentially, these critical path tasks are completely necessary to be completed in full in order for the project to finish.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilize Management Software</strong> to help get a technological edge in combating constraints.  Software like ProjectManager has resource management tools built-in that help allocate resources and team members, and has a project calendar so that you can see projected task completion times as well as team member contribution and progress.  Software like this can also help your resource optimization, as a visualization of your project’s progress can help iron out any excessive resource usage.  In addition to these perks, management software is an all-around good strategy to employ in large-scale teams in order to have good control over not just your project resources, but where those resources are going toward as well as the resource balance between various tasks.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Knowing your project constraints is knowing your project’s sandbox, and while they may seem annoying at first, you may find that they help build your project management experience through challenge and eventually triumph.  The more you can grasp your constraints means the more control you have over your project and where it is headed, and that’s a great spot to be in as a project manager.</li>
