    <h2>Acquiring Your Tools with Procurement Management</h2>
    <div class="contain backer stacker" style="border:2px solid #2d545e"> 
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Now that you know how to manage your project’s resources and mitigate risks, it’s time to talk about how you will be granted your project’s resources.  Project procurement management covers how you will plan out what you need and how you will get what you need for your project team.  Good project procurement management can give projects above adequate resources at a good rate that leaves ample budget room.  Bad procurement management could leave you with the opposite.  In this guide, I’ll cover the various angles of procurement management as well as the techniques involved with each.</li>        
        </ul>
        <h3>Pre-Procurement and Planning</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>As with many things in project management, you have to start with a plan and procurement is no different.  When planning your project procurement you should take into consideration the various needs of your project.  What can your company provide for you?  If your company provides the resources for your project then you won’t have to reach third party suppliers, which will likely save a lot of money.  You also want to plan the necessary delivery dates for anything that needs to be delivered.  You don’t want to have tasks scheduled before their required resources arrive, of course.  Are there suppliers that have good/bad reputation from past projects?  In order to procure well, you have to look at the histories of potential suppliers before you give the go-ahead to procure.  If there’s a change in the delivery schedule after a contract has been signed, you also need to have a plan as to how to handle the unexpected change.</li>
            <li>While these are some of the questions that you have to ask yourself when procuring resources, it isn’t an exhaustive list and there are more that you should ask before undergoing procurement.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Time to Procure!</h3>
        <ul class="order">
            <li>After you plan your procurements, it’s time to carry them out.  Conducting procurements involves releasing your request for proposals (RFP) in order to garner attention of potential suppliers.  In addition to sending out RFPs, you also have the control procurements process, which acts just like the monitoring and controlling aspects of other project management activities.</li>
            <li>An important note is that you as a project manager do not actually conduct procurements yourself, but you still have to overlook the procurement process and make changes to that process as needed.  When something like a shipping delay or mismatching schedule arrives, then you have to make crucial decisions for the procurement: do you pay for faster shipping, do you adjust for the delay, or do you try to procure from another supplier that could fit your needs?  These are the kinds of questions you have to ask yourself during the procurement, ones that require good planning and previous knowledge of your project’s schedule.</li>
            <li>You also want to ensure that your suppliers are providing what they are supposed to provide.  Quality control comes in handy here, as you can assign people to oversee the supplier’s contributions.  In some cases, you may also sign a contract with suppliers that provide legal protection in this situation, but in the absence of one, it’s good to have scheduled meetings and inspections to ensure that everything is going well and that there is no misunderstanding between your project team and the providers.</li>
        </ul>
