        <h3>Procurement Management</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>Project Procurement has been changing throughout the years on a constant basis. The modern world of project management focuses very heavily on technology, so with the new cutting-edge technology being introduced, the world of Procurement management has been changing along with it. This makes the process, which was once very tedious and boring into more of a streamlined efficient process. This blog will show you how technology has transformed this process and the ways in which technology enhances the development process for you and your team.</li>
            <li><b>Past Procurement Management</b>: The past of procurement was typically very heavy in the paperwork department, costing a lot of time in manual writing and organization of files. I'm sure we all know the pain of looking for a paper that you wrote in your binder filled with schoolwork. Imagine that same scenario but in an office setting, digging through a filing cabinet with hundreds or thousands of documents. This process has been replaced by digital assets which completely reformed the way we do things, and greatly decreased downtime by making things readily accessible and much easier to find.</li>

        <h3>Digitalization</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li><b>Digital Tools</b>: Digital tools being the new way of doing things have streamlined the process of procurement exponentially. <i>Project Procurement</i> is the way in which we find resources needed for a project. This could be something like a construction company that is building an apartment complex. They would need the following resources: Labor, materials for building, machinery, and permits/paperwork that go along with the work they are doing. In a software development project, a team could be using procurement to document the technologies they are using, such as programming languages, frameworks, development flow (agile/waterfall, etc), and manpower.</li>
            <li>Using digital tools throughout the process of procurement, you as a project manager can increase the productivity in the following ways. Using digital tools for procurement, you can make visual roadmaps/graphs of the procurement of your project. This can greatly increase the readability of your documents, as you could make a roadmap of the certain resources you are using and the timeline of when you are going to need them. It also makes the procurement process faster in the way that you do not need to handwrite everything and as it is digitalized, it is easier to organize and doesn't take up any physical space. By digitalizing your companies actions, you can better share the documents to others without a risk of losing documents, needing to make copies or spending time communicating to others when simply using digital technologies will solve the entire problem for you. Many companies nowadays need documents to be digitalized due to remote work becoming more and more popular, so employees and managers need to be able to see documents while they are working remotely.</li>
            <li><b>Automation</b>: Digitalizing the procurement management process means that much of the tasks you would otherwise have to do (in a manual work setting) can be automated. This means that many of the tedious things you would need to do throughout the procurement process will automatically be done by a computer, such as organization, formatting, visual interface, etc. It also allows for the team as a whole to collaborate on the documents together, which differs from the way in which handwriting a document would be (typically just done by one person, maybe edited by another after completion).</li>
            <li><b>Time</b>: You as a project manager probably know by now that the most precious resource for you and your team is <i>time</i>. Time is a big thing many companies face issues with when it comes to getting a project done and completed, whether it be because of a time crunch placed on you by shareholders, a holdup in development due to an issue in development, etc. Using digital tools throughout project procurement management will save you a ton of time throughout the process, oftentimes it will nearly half the time otherwise spent in the process. This alone is enough of a reason to make the change to using digital technologies to manage your project procurement.</li>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <ul class="order menu">
            <li>As a project manager, the challenges you face along the way of completing a project are almost certainly not unique. When you come across an issue throughout development, more times than not you can reach out or research on the issue you are facing and find a solution. Many other project managers have run into issues throughout procurement management, so just know you are not alone. Many other managers in the world have found time issues throughout procurement management, and typically using technologies designed for your use is going to be the best route to save that precious time to meet your deadline on time.</li>
